gitattributes - defining attributes per path
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
$GIT_DIR/info/attributes, .gitattributes
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
A <B>gitattributes</B> file is a simple text file that gives <B>attributes</B> to pathnames.
<P>
Each line in <B>gitattributes</B> file is of form:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
pattern attr1 attr2 ...
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
That is, a pattern followed by an attributes list, separated by whitespaces. Leading and trailing whitespaces are ignored. Lines that begin with <I>#</I> are ignored. Patterns that begin with a double quote are quoted in C style. When the pattern matches the path in question, the attributes listed on the line are given to the path.
<P>
Each attribute can be in one of these states for a given path:
<P>

Set
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The path has the attribute with special value &quot;true&quot;; this is specified by listing only the name of the attribute in the attribute list.
</DL>

<P>

Unset
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The path has the attribute with special value &quot;false&quot;; this is specified by listing the name of the attribute prefixed with a dash
<B>-</B>
in the attribute list.
</DL>

<P>

Set to a value
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The path has the attribute with specified string value; this is specified by listing the name of the attribute followed by an equal sign
<B>=</B>
and its value in the attribute list.
</DL>

<P>

Unspecified
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
No pattern matches the path, and nothing says if the path has or does not have the attribute, the attribute for the path is said to be Unspecified.
</DL>

<P>
When more than one pattern matches the path, a later line overrides an earlier line. This overriding is done per attribute. The rules how the pattern matches paths are the same as in <B>.gitignore</B> files; see <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+gitignore">gitignore</A></B>(5). Unlike <B>.gitignore</B>, negative patterns are forbidden.
<P>
When deciding what attributes are assigned to a path, Git consults <B>$GIT_DIR/info/attributes</B> file (which has the highest precedence), <B>.gitattributes</B> file in the same directory as the path in question, and its parent directories up to the toplevel of the work tree (the further the directory that contains <B>.gitattributes</B> is from the path in question, the lower its precedence). Finally global and system-wide files are considered (they have the lowest precedence).
<P>
When the <B>.gitattributes</B> file is missing from the work tree, the path in the index is used as a fall-back. During checkout process, <B>.gitattributes</B> in the index is used and then the file in the working tree is used as a fall-back.
<P>
If you wish to affect only a single repository (i.e., to assign attributes to files that are particular to one usercqs workflow for that repository), then attributes should be placed in the <B>$GIT_DIR/info/attributes</B> file. Attributes which should be version-controlled and distributed to other repositories (i.e., attributes of interest to all users) should go into <B>.gitattributes</B> files. Attributes that should affect all repositories for a single user should be placed in a file specified by the <B>core.attributesFile</B> configuration option (see <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git-config">git-config</A></B>(1)). Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/attributes is used instead. Attributes for all users on a system should be placed in the <B>$(prefix)/etc/gitattributes</B> file.
<P>
Sometimes you would need to override a setting of an attribute for a path to <B>Unspecified</B> state. This can be done by listing the name of the attribute prefixed with an exclamation point <B>!</B>.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EFFECTS</H2>

<P>
Certain operations by Git can be influenced by assigning particular attributes to a path. Currently, the following operations are attributes-aware.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Checking-out and checking-in</H3>

<P>
These attributes affect how the contents stored in the repository are copied to the working tree files when commands such as <I>git checkout</I> and <I>git merge</I> run. They also affect how Git stores the contents you prepare in the working tree in the repository upon <I>git add</I> and <I>git commit</I>.
<P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<B>text</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
This attribute enables and controls end-of-line normalization. When a text file is normalized, its line endings are converted to LF in the repository. To control what line ending style is used in the working directory, use the <B>eol</B> attribute for a single file and the <B>core.eol</B> configuration variable for all text files. Note that <B>core.autocrlf</B> overrides <B>core.eol</B>
<P>

Set
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Setting the
<B>text</B>
attribute on a path enables end-of-line normalization and marks the path as a text file. End-of-line conversion takes place without guessing the content type.
</DL>

<P>

Unset
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Unsetting the
<B>text</B>
attribute on a path tells Git not to attempt any end-of-line conversion upon checkin or checkout.
</DL>

<P>

Set to string value &quot;auto&quot;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When
<B>text</B>
is set to &quot;auto&quot;, the path is marked for automatic end-of-line conversion. If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings are converted to LF on checkin. When the file has been committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.
</DL>

<P>

Unspecified
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
If the
<B>text</B>
attribute is unspecified, Git uses the
<B>core.autocrlf</B>
configuration variable to determine if the file should be converted.
</DL>

<P>
Any other value causes Git to act as if <B>text</B> has been left unspecified.
</DL>

<P>



<BR>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2">
<B>eol</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
This attribute sets a specific line-ending style to be used in the working directory. It enables end-of-line conversion without any content checks, effectively setting the <B>text</B> attribute.
<P>

Set to string value &quot;crlf&quot;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This setting forces Git to normalize line endings for this file on checkin and convert them to CRLF when the file is checked out.
</DL>

<P>

Set to string value &quot;lf&quot;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This setting forces Git to normalize line endings to LF on checkin and prevents conversion to CRLF when the file is checked out.

</FONT><FONT SIZE="+3">
<B>Backwards compatibility with crlf attribute</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
For backwards compatibility, the <B>crlf</B> attribute is interpreted as follows:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



</FONT><PRE>
crlf            text
-crlf           -text
crlf=input      eol=lf

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<B>End-of-line conversion</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
While Git normally leaves file contents alone, it can be configured to normalize line endings to LF in the repository and, optionally, to convert them to CRLF when files are checked out.
<P>
If you simply want to have CRLF line endings in your working directory regardless of the repository you are working with, you can set the config variable &quot;core.autocrlf&quot; without using any attributes.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



</FONT><PRE>
[core]
        autocrlf = true
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
This does not force normalization of text files, but does ensure that text files that you introduce to the repository have their line endings normalized to LF when they are added, and that files that are already normalized in the repository stay normalized.
<P>
If you want to ensure that text files that any contributor introduces to the repository have their line endings normalized, you can set the <B>text</B> attribute to &quot;auto&quot; for <I>all</I> files.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
*       text=auto
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
The attributes allow a fine-grained control, how the line endings are converted. Here is an example that will make Git normalize .txt, .vcproj and .sh files, ensure that .vcproj files have CRLF and .sh files have LF in the working directory, and prevent .jpg files from being normalized regardless of their content.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
*               text=auto
*.txt           text

<P>
When <B>text=auto</B> conversion is enabled in a cross-platform project using push and pull to a central repository the text files containing CRLFs should be normalized.

<P>
<P>
If any files that should not be normalized show up in <I>git status</I>, unset their <B>text</B> attribute before running <I>git add -u</I>.

<P>
<P>
If <B>core.safecrlf</B> is set to &quot;true&quot; or &quot;warn&quot;, Git verifies if the conversion is reversible for the current setting of <B>core.autocrlf</B>. For &quot;true&quot;, Git rejects irreversible conversions; for &quot;warn&quot;, Git only prints a warning but accepts an irreversible conversion. The safety triggers to prevent such a conversion done to the files in the work tree, but there are a few exceptions. Even though...

<B>ident</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
When the attribute <B>ident</B> is set for a path, Git replaces <B>$Id$</B> in the blob object with <B>$Id:</B>, followed by the 40-character hexadecimal blob object name, followed by a dollar sign <B>$</B> upon checkout. Any byte sequence that begins with <B>$Id:</B> and ends with <B>$</B> in the worktree file is replaced with <B>$Id$</B> upon check-in.
</DL>

<P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2">
<B>filter</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
A <B>filter</B> attribute can be set to a string value that names a filter driver specified in the configuration.
<P>
A filter driver consists of a <B>clean</B> command and a <B>smudge</B> command, either of which can be left unspecified. Upon checkout, when the <B>smudge</B> command is specified, the command is fed the blob object from its standard input, and its standard output is used to update the worktree file. Similarly, the <B>clean</B> command is used to convert the contents of worktree file upon checkin. By default these commands process only a single blob and terminate. If a long running <B>process</B> filter is used in place of <B>clean</B> and/or <B>smudge</B> filters, then Git can process all blobs with a single filter command invocation for the entire life of a single Git command, for example <B>git add --all</B>. If a long running <B>process</B> filter is configured then it always takes precedence over a configured single blob filter. See section below for the description of the protocol used to communicate with a <B>process</B> filter.
<P>
One use of the content filtering is to massage the content into a shape that is more convenient for the platform, filesystem, and the user to use. For this mode of operation, the key phrase here is &quot;more convenient&quot; and not &quot;turning something unusable into usable&quot;. In other words, the intent is that if someone unsets the filter driver definition, or does not have the appropriate filter program, the project should still be usable.
<P>
Another use of the content filtering is to store the content that cannot be directly used in the repository (e.g. a UUID that refers to the true content stored outside Git, or an encrypted content) and turn it into a usable form upon checkout (e.g. download the external content, or decrypt the encrypted content).
<P>
These two filters behave differently, and by default, a filter is taken as the former, massaging the contents into more convenient shape. A missing filter driver definition in the config, or a filter driver that exits with a non-zero status, is not an error but makes the filter a no-op passthru.
<P>
You can declare that a filter turns a content that by itself is unusable into a usable content by setting the filter.&lt;driver&gt;.required configuration variable to <B>true</B>.
<P>
For example, in .gitattributes, you would assign the <B>filter</B> attribute for paths.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



</FONT><PRE>
*.c     filter=indent
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
Then you would define a &quot;filter.indent.clean&quot; and &quot;filter.indent.smudge&quot; configuration in your .git/config to specify a pair of commands to modify the contents of C programs when the source files are checked in (&quot;clean&quot; is run) and checked out (no change is made because the command is &quot;cat&quot;).
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
[filter &quot;indent&quot;]
        clean = indent
        smudge = cat
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
For best results, <B>clean</B> should not alter its output further if it is run twice (&quot;clean->clean&quot; should be equivalent to &quot;clean&quot;), and multiple <B>smudge</B> commands should not alter <B>clean</B>'s output (&quot;smudge->smudge->clean&quot; should be equivalent to &quot;clean&quot;). See the section on merging below.
<P>
The &quot;indent&quot; filter is well-behaved in this regard: it will not modify input that is already correctly indented. In this case, the lack of a smudge filter means that the clean filter <I>must</I> accept its own output without modifying it.
<P>
If a filter <I>must</I> succeed in order to make the stored contents usable, you can declare that the filter is <B>required</B>, in the configuration:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
[filter &quot;crypt&quot;]
        clean = openssl enc ...
        smudge = openssl enc -d ...
        required
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
Sequence &quot;%f&quot; on the filter command line is replaced with the name of the file the filter is working on. A filter might use this in keyword substitution. For example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
[filter &quot;p4&quot;]
        clean = git-p4-filter --clean %f
        smudge = git-p4-filter --smudge %f
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
Note that &quot;%f&quot; is the name of the path that is being worked on. Depending on the version that is being filtered, the corresponding file on disk may not exist, or may have different contents. So, smudge and clean commands should not try to access the file on disk, but only act as filters on the content provided to them on standard input.
</DL>

<P>



<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<B>Long Running Filter Process</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
If the filter command (a string value) is defined via <B>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.process</B> then Git can process all blobs with a single filter invocation for the entire life of a single Git command. This is achieved by using a packet format (pkt-line, see technical/protocol-common.txt) based protocol over standard input and standard output as follows. All packets, except for the &quot;*CONTENT&quot; packets and the &quot;0000&quot; flush packet, are considered text and therefore are terminated by a LF.
<P>
Git starts the filter when it encounters the first file that needs to be cleaned or smudged. After the filter started Git sends a welcome message (&quot;git-filter-client&quot;), a list of supported protocol version numbers, and a flush packet. Git expects to read a welcome response message (&quot;git-filter-server&quot;), exactly one protocol version number from the previously sent list, and a flush packet. All further communication will be based on the selected version. The remaining protocol description below documents &quot;version=2&quot;. Please note that &quot;version=42&quot; in the example below does not exist and is only there to illustrate how the protocol would look like with more than one version.
<P>
After the version negotiation Git sends a list of all capabilities that it supports and a flush packet. Git expects to read a list of desired capabilities, which must be a subset of the supported capabilities list, and a flush packet as response:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



</FONT><PRE>
packet:          git&gt; git-filter-client
packet:          git&gt; version=2
packet:          git&gt; version=42
packet:          git&gt; 0000
packet:          git&lt; git-filter-server

packet:          git&gt; 0000
packet:          git&lt; capability=clean
packet:          git&lt; capability=smudge

</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
Supported filter capabilities in version 2 are &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;smudge&quot;.
<P>
Afterwards Git sends a list of &quot;key=value&quot; pairs terminated with a flush packet. The list will contain at least the filter command (based on the supported capabilities) and the pathname of the file to filter relative to the repository root. Right after the flush packet Git sends the content split in zero or more pkt-line packets and a flush packet to terminate content. Please note, that the filter must not send any response before it received the content and the final flush packet. Also note that the &quot;value&quot; of a &quot;key=value&quot; pair can contain the &quot;=&quot; character whereas the key would never contain that character.
<P>

<P>
<P>
The filter is expected to respond with a list of &quot;key=value&quot; pairs terminated with a flush packet. If the filter does not experience problems then the list must contain a &quot;success&quot; status. Right after these packets the filter is expected to send the content in zero or more pkt-line packets and a flush packet at the end. Finally, a second list of &quot;key=value&quot; pairs terminated with a flush packet is expected. The filter can change the status in the second list or keep the status as is with an empty list. Please note that the empty list must be terminated with a flush packet regardless.

<P>
<P>
If the result content is empty then the filter is expected to respond with a &quot;success&quot; status and a flush packet to signal the empty content.

<P>
<P>
In case the filter cannot or does not want to process the content as well as any future content for the lifetime of the Git process, then it is expected to respond with an &quot;abort&quot; status at any point in the protocol.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
packet:          git&lt; status=abort
packet:          git&lt; 0000
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
Git neither stops nor restarts the filter process in case the &quot;error&quot;/&quot;abort&quot; status is set. However, Git sets its exit code according to the <B>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.required</B> flag, mimicking the behavior of the <B>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.clean</B> / <B>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.smudge</B> mechanism.
<P>
If the filter dies during the communication or does not adhere to the protocol then Git will stop the filter process and restart it with the next file that needs to be processed. Depending on the <B>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.required</B> flag Git will interpret that as error.
<P>
After the filter has processed a blob it is expected to wait for the next &quot;key=value&quot; list containing a command. Git will close the command pipe on exit. The filter is expected to detect EOF and exit gracefully on its own. Git will wait until the filter process has stopped.
<P>
A long running filter demo implementation can be found in <B>contrib/long-running-filter/example.pl</B> located in the Git core repository. If you develop your own long running filter process then the <B>GIT_TRACE_PACKET</B> environment variables can be very helpful for debugging (see <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git">git</A></B>(1)).
<P>
Please note that you cannot use an existing <B>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.clean</B> or <B>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.smudge</B> command with <B>filter.&lt;driver&gt;.process</B> because the former two use a different inter process communication protocol than the latter one.

<B>Interaction between checkin/checkout attributes</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
In the check-in codepath, the worktree file is first converted with <B>filter</B> driver (if specified and corresponding driver defined), then the result is processed with <B>ident</B> (if specified), and then finally with <B>text</B> (again, if specified and applicable).
<P>
In the check-out codepath, the blob content is first converted with <B>text</B>, and then <B>ident</B> and fed to <B>filter</B>.
</DL>

<P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2">
<B>Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout attributes</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
If you have added attributes to a file that cause the canonical repository format for that file to change, such as adding a clean/smudge filter or text/eol/ident attributes, merging anything where the attribute is not in place would normally cause merge conflicts.
<P>
To prevent these unnecessary merge conflicts, Git can be told to run a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge by setting the <B>merge.renormalize</B> configuration variable. This prevents changes caused by check-in conversion from causing spurious merge conflicts when a converted file is merged with an unconverted file.
<P>
As long as a &quot;smudge->clean&quot; results in the same output as a &quot;clean&quot; even on files that are already smudged, this strategy will automatically resolve all filter-related conflicts. Filters that do not act in this way may cause additional merge conflicts that must be resolved manually.

<B>Performing text diffs of binary files</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
Sometimes it is desirable to see the diff of a text-converted version of some binary files. For example, a word processor document can be converted to an ASCII text representation, and the diff of the text shown. Even though this conversion loses some information, the resulting diff is useful for human viewing (but cannot be applied directly).
<P>
The <B>textconv</B> config option is used to define a program for performing such a conversion. The program should take a single argument, the name of a file to convert, and produce the resulting text on stdout.
<P>
For example, to show the diff of the exif information of a file instead of the binary information (assuming you have the exif tool installed), add the following section to your <B>$GIT_DIR/config</B> file (or <B>$HOME/.gitconfig</B> file):
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



</FONT><PRE>
[diff &quot;jpg&quot;]
        textconv = exif
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>



<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<B>Note</B>
</FONT>
<BR>

<P>
The text conversion is generally a one-way conversion; in this example, we lose the actual image contents and focus just on the text data. This means that diffs generated by textconv are <I>not</I> suitable for applying. For this reason, only <B>git diff</B> and the <B>git log</B> family of commands (i.e., log, whatchanged, show) will perform text conversion. <B>git format-patch</B> will never generate this output. If you want to send somebody a text-converted diff of a binary file (e.g., because it quickly conveys the changes you have made), you should generate it separately and send it as a comment <I>in addition to</I> the usual binary diff that you might send.
<P>
</DL>

<P>
Because text conversion can be slow, especially when doing a large number of them with <B>git log -p</B>, Git provides a mechanism to cache the output and use it in future diffs. To enable caching, set the &quot;cachetextconv&quot; variable in your diff drivercqs config. For example:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



<PRE>
[diff &quot;jpg&quot;]
        textconv = exif
        cachetextconv = true
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
This will cache the result of running &quot;exif&quot; on each blob indefinitely. If you change the textconv config variable for a diff driver, Git will automatically invalidate the cache entries and re-run the textconv filter. If you want to invalidate the cache manually (e.g., because your version of &quot;exif&quot; was updated and now produces better output), you can remove the cache manually with <B>git update-ref -d refs/notes/textconv/jpg</B> (where &quot;jpg&quot; is the name of the diff driver, as in the example above).
</DL>

<P>



<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<B>Choosing textconv versus external diff</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
If you want to show differences between binary or specially-formatted blobs in your repository, you can choose to use either an external diff command, or to use textconv to convert them to a diff-able text format. Which method you choose depends on your exact situation.
<P>
The advantage of using an external diff command is flexibility. You are not bound to find line-oriented changes, nor is it necessary for the output to resemble unified diff. You are free to locate and report changes in the most appropriate way for your data format.
<P>
A textconv, by comparison, is much more limiting. You provide a transformation of the data into a line-oriented text format, and Git uses its regular diff tools to generate the output. There are several advantages to choosing this method:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
 1.


Ease of use. It is often much simpler to write a binary to text transformation than it is to perform your own diff. In many cases, existing programs can be used as textconv filters (e.g., exif, odt2txt).
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
 2.


Git diff features. By performing only the transformation step yourself, you can still utilize many of Gitcqs diff features, including colorization, word-diff, and combined diffs for merges.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
 3.


Caching. Textconv caching can speed up repeated diffs, such as those you might trigger by running
<B>git log -p</B>.
</DL>

</DL>

<P>



<BR>

</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2">
<B>Marking files as binary</B>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
Git usually guesses correctly whether a blob contains text or binary data by examining the beginning of the contents. However, sometimes you may want to override its decision, either because a blob contains binary data later in the file, or because the content, while technically composed of text characters, is opaque to a human reader. For example, many postscript files contain only ASCII characters, but produce noisy and meaningless diffs.
<P>
The simplest way to mark a file as binary is to unset the diff attribute in the <B>.gitattributes</B> file:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>



</FONT><PRE>
*.ps -diff
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
<P>
This will cause Git to generate <B>Binary files differ</B> (or a binary patch, if binary patches are enabled) instead of a regular diff.
<P>
However, one may also want to specify other diff driver attributes. For example, you might want to use <B>textconv</B> to convert postscript files to an ASCII representation for human viewing, but otherwise treat them as binary files. You cannot specify both <B>-diff</B> and <B>diff=ps</B> attributes. The solution is to use the <B>diff.*.binary</B> config option:
