git-mailinfo - Extracts patch and authorship from a single e-mail message
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
<PRE>
<I>git mailinfo</I> [-k|-b] [-u | --encoding=&lt;encoding&gt; | -n] [--[no-]scissors] &lt;msg&gt; &lt;patch&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Reads a single e-mail message from the standard input, and writes the commit log message in &lt;msg&gt; file, and the patches in &lt;patch&gt; file. The author name, e-mail and e-mail subject are written out to the standard output to be used by <I>git am</I> to create a commit. It is usually not necessary to use this command directly. See <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git-am">git-am</A></B>(1) instead.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

-k
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Usually the program removes email cruft from the Subject: header line to extract the title line for the commit log message. This option prevents this munging, and is most useful when used to read back
<I>git format-patch -k</I>
output.
<P>
Specifically, the following are removed until none of them remain:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


Leading and trailing whitespace.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


Leading
<B>Re:</B>,
<B>re:</B>, and
<B>:</B>.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


Leading bracketed strings (between
<B>[</B>
and
<B>]</B>, usually
<B>[PATCH]</B>).
</DL>

<P>
Finally, runs of whitespace are normalized to a single ASCII space character.
</DL>

<P>

-b
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When -k is not in effect, all leading strings bracketed with
<I>[</I>
and
<I>]</I>
pairs are stripped. This option limits the stripping to only the pairs whose bracketed string contains the word &quot;PATCH&quot;.
</DL>

<P>

-u
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The commit log message, author name and author email are taken from the e-mail, and after minimally decoding MIME transfer encoding, re-coded in the charset specified by i18n.commitencoding (defaulting to UTF-8) by transliterating them. This used to be optional but now it is the default.
<P>
Note that the patch is always used as-is without charset conversion, even with this flag.
</DL>

<P>

--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Similar to -u. But when re-coding, the charset specified here is used instead of the one specified by i18n.commitencoding or UTF-8.
</DL>

<P>

-n
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Disable all charset re-coding of the metadata.
</DL>

<P>

-m, --message-id
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Copy the Message-ID header at the end of the commit message. This is useful in order to associate commits with mailing list discussions.
</DL>

<P>

--scissors
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Remove everything in body before a scissors line. A line that mainly consists of scissors (either &quot;&gt;8&quot; or &quot;8&lt;&quot;) and perforation (dash &quot;-&quot;) marks is called a scissors line, and is used to request the reader to cut the message at that line. If such a line appears in the body of the message before the patch, everything before it (including the scissors line itself) is ignored when this option is used.
<P>
This is useful if you want to begin your message in a discussion thread with comments and suggestions on the message you are responding to, and to conclude it with a patch submission, separating the discussion and the beginning of the proposed commit log message with a scissors line.
<P>
This can be enabled by default with the configuration option mailinfo.scissors.
</DL>

<P>

--no-scissors
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Ignore scissors lines. Useful for overriding mailinfo.scissors settings.
</DL>

<P>

&lt;msg&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The commit log message extracted from e-mail, usually except the title line which comes from e-mail Subject.
</DL>

<P>

&lt;patch&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The patch extracted from e-mail.
