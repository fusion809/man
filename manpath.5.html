<H2>NAME</H2>

manpath - format of the /etc/man_db.conf file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The manpath configuration file is used by the manual page utilities
to assess users' manpaths at run time, to indicate which manual page
hierarchies (manpaths) are to be treated as system hierarchies and to
assign them directories to be used for storing cat files.
<P>
If the environment variable
$<B>MANPATH</B>

is already set, the information contained within /etc/man_db.conf will
not override it.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FORMAT</H2>

The following field types are currently recognised:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>#</B><I>&nbsp;comment</I>

<DD>
Blank lines or those beginning with a
<B>#</B>

will be treated as comments and ignored.
<DT><B>MANDATORY_MANPATH</B><I>&nbsp;manpath_element</I>

<DD>
Lines of this form indicate manpaths that every automatically generated
$<B>MANPATH</B>

should contain.
This will typically include
<I>/usr/man</I>.

<DT><B>MANPATH_MAP</B><I>&nbsp;path_element&nbsp;manpath_element</I>

<DD>
Lines of this form set up
$<B>PATH</B>

to
$<B>MANPATH</B>

mappings.
For each
<I>path_element</I>

found in the user's
$<B>PATH</B>,

<I>manpath_element</I>

will be added to the
$<B>MANPATH</B>.

<DT><B>MANDB_MAP </B><I>manpath_element </I>[ <I>catpath_element</I> ]<DD>
Lines of this form indicate which manpaths are to be treated as system
manpaths, and optionally where their cat files should be stored.
This field type is particularly important if
<B>man</B>

is a setuid program, as (when in the system configuration file
/etc/man_db.conf rather than the per-user configuration file .manpath)
it indicates which manual page hierarchies to access as the setuid user and
which as the invoking user.
<P>
The system manual page hierarchies are usually those stored under
<I>/usr</I>

such as
<I>/usr/man</I>,

<I>/usr/local/man</I>

and
<I>/usr/X11R6/man</I>.

<P>
If cat pages from a particular
<I>manpath_element</I>

are not to be stored or are to be stored in the traditional location,
<I>catpath_element</I>

may be omitted.
<P>
Traditional cat placement would be impossible for read only mounted manual
page hierarchies and because of this it is possible to specify any valid
directory hierarchy for their storage.
To observe the
<B>Linux FSSTND</B>

the keyword
`<B>FSSTND</B>

can be used in place of an actual directory.
<P>
Unfortunately, it is necessary to specify
<B>all</B>

system man tree paths, including alternate operating system paths such as
<I>/usr/man/sun</I>

and any
<B>NLS locale</B>

paths such as
<I>/usr/man/de_DE.88591</I>.

<P>
As the information is parsed line by line in the order written, it is
necessary for any manpath that is a sub-hierarchy of another hierarchy to be
listed first, otherwise an incorrect match will be made.
An example is that
<I>/usr/man/de_DE.88591</I>

must come before
<I>/usr/man</I>.

<DT><B>DEFINE</B><I>&nbsp;key&nbsp;value</I>

<DD>
Lines of this form define miscellaneous configuration variables; see the
default configuration file for those variables used by the manual pager
utilities.
They include default paths to various programs (such as
<I>grep</I>

and
<I>tbl</I>),

and default sets of arguments to those programs.
<DT><B>SECTION</B> <I>section</I> ...<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Lines of this form define the order in which manual sections should be
searched.
If there are no
<B>SECTION</B>

directives in the configuration file, the default is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SECTION 1 n l 8 3 0 2 5 4 9 6 7
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If multiple
<B>SECTION</B>

directives are given, their section lists will be concatenated.
<P>

If a particular extension is not in this list (say, 1mh) it will be
displayed with the rest of the section it belongs to.
The effect of this is that you only need to explicitly list extensions if
you want to force a particular order.
Sections with extensions should usually be adjacent to their main section
(e.g. &quot;1 1mh 8 ...&quot;).
<P>

<B>SECTIONS</B>

is accepted as an alternative name for this directive.
</DL>

<DT><B>MINCATWIDTH</B><I>&nbsp;width</I>

<DD>
If the terminal width is less than
<I>width</I>,

cat pages will not be created (if missing) or displayed.
The default is 80.
<DT><B>MAXCATWIDTH</B><I>&nbsp;width</I>

<DD>
If the terminal width is greater than
<I>width</I>,

cat pages will not be created (if missing) or displayed.
The default is 80.
<DT><B>CATWIDTH</B><I>&nbsp;width</I>

<DD>
If
<I>width</I>

is non-zero, cat pages will always be formatted for a terminal of the given
width, regardless of the width of the terminal actually being used.
This should generally be within the range set by
<B>MINCATWIDTH</B>

and
<B>MAXCATWIDTH</B>.

<DT><B>NOCACHE</B>

<DD>
This flag prevents
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+man">man</A></B>(1)

from creating cat pages automatically.
</DL>

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Unless the rules above are followed and observed precisely, the manual pager
utilities will not function as desired.
The rules are overly complicated.
