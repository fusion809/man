<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>WARNING:</B> <B>git cvsimport</B> uses cvsps version 2, which is considered deprecated; it does not work with cvsps version 3 and later. If you are performing a one-shot import of a CVS repository consider using m[blue]<B>cvs2git</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT> or m[blue]<B>cvs-fast-export</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>.
<P>
Imports a CVS repository into Git. It will either create a new repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.
<P>
Splitting the CVS log into patch sets is done by <I>cvsps</I>. At least version 2.1 is required.
<P>
<B>WARNING:</B> for certain situations the import leads to incorrect results. Please see the section ISSUES for further reference.
<P>
You should <B>never</B> do any work of your own on the branches that are created by <I>git cvsimport</I>. By default initial import will create and populate a &quot;master&quot; branch from the CVS repositorycqs main branch which youcqre free to work with; after that, you need to <I>git merge</I> incremental imports, or any CVS branches, yourself. It is advisable to specify a named remote via -r to separate and protect the incoming branches.
<P>
If you intend to set up a shared public repository that all developers can read/write, or if you want to use <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git-cvsserver">git-cvsserver</A></B>(1), then you probably want to make a bare clone of the imported repository, and use the clone as the shared repository. See <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+gitcvs-migration">gitcvs-migration</A></B>(7).

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

-v
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Verbosity: let
<I>cvsimport</I>
report what it is doing.
</DL>

<P>

-d &lt;CVSROOT&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The root of the CVS archive. May be local (a simple path) or remote; currently, only the :local:, :ext: and :pserver: access methods are supported. If not given,
<I>git cvsimport</I>
will try to read it from
<B>CVS/Root</B>. If no such file exists, it checks for the
<B>CVSROOT</B>
environment variable.
</DL>

<P>

&lt;CVS_module&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The CVS module you want to import. Relative to &lt;CVSROOT&gt;. If not given,
<I>git cvsimport</I>
tries to read it from
<B>CVS/Repository</B>.
</DL>

<P>

-C &lt;target-dir&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The Git repository to import to. If the directory doesncqt exist, it will be created. Default is the current directory.
</DL>

<P>

-r &lt;remote&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The Git remote to import this CVS repository into. Moves all CVS branches into remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt; akin to the way
<I>git clone</I>
uses
<I>origin</I>
by default.
</DL>

<P>

-o &lt;branch-for-HEAD&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When no remote is specified (via -r) the
<B>HEAD</B>
branch from CVS is imported to the
<I>origin</I>
branch within the Git repository, as
<B>HEAD</B>
already has a special meaning for Git. When a remote is specified the
<B>HEAD</B>
branch is named remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/master mirroring
<I>git clone</I>
behaviour. Use this option if you want to import into a different branch.
<P>
Use
<I>-o master</I>
for continuing an import that was initially done by the old cvs2git tool.
</DL>

<P>

-i
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Import-only: doncqt perform a checkout after importing. This option ensures the working directory and index remain untouched and will not create them if they do not exist.
</DL>

<P>

-k
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Kill keywords: will extract files with
<I>-kk</I>
from the CVS archive to avoid noisy changesets. Highly recommended, but off by default to preserve compatibility with early imported trees.
</DL>

<P>

-u
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Convert underscores in tag and branch names to dots.
</DL>

<P>

-s &lt;subst&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Substitute the character &quot;/&quot; in branch names with &lt;subst&gt;
</DL>

<P>

-p &lt;options-for-cvsps&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Additional options for cvsps. The options
<B>-u</B>
and
<I>-A</I>
are implicit and should not be used here.
<P>
If you need to pass multiple options, separate them with a comma.
</DL>

<P>

-z &lt;fuzz&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Pass the timestamp fuzz factor to cvsps, in seconds. If unset, cvsps defaults to 300s.
</DL>

<P>

-P &lt;cvsps-output-file&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Instead of calling cvsps, read the provided cvsps output file. Useful for debugging or when cvsps is being handled outside cvsimport.
</DL>

<P>

-m
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message. This option will enable default regexes that try to capture the source branch name from the commit message.
</DL>

<P>

-M &lt;regex&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message with a custom regex. It can be used with
<B>-m</B>
to enable the default regexes as well. You must escape forward slashes.
<P>
The regex must capture the source branch name in $1.
<P>
This option can be used several times to provide several detection regexes.
</DL>

<P>

-S &lt;regex&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Skip paths matching the regex.
</DL>

<P>

-a
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Import all commits, including recent ones. cvsimport by default skips commits that have a timestamp less than 10 minutes ago.
</DL>

<P>

-L &lt;limit&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Limit the number of commits imported. Workaround for cases where cvsimport leaks memory.
</DL>

<P>

-A &lt;author-conv-file&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
CVS by default uses the Unix username when writing its commit logs. Using this option and an author-conv-file maps the name recorded in CVS to author name, e-mail and optional time zone:

</DL>




<P>
<I>git cvsimport</I>
will make it appear as those authors had their GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL set properly all along. If a time zone is specified, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE will have the corresponding offset applied.
<P>
For convenience, this data is saved to
<B>$GIT_DIR/cvs-authors</B>
each time the
<I>-A</I>
option is provided and read from that same file each time
<I>git cvsimport</I>
is run.
<P>
It is not recommended to use this feature if you intend to export changes back to CVS again later with
<I>git cvsexportcommit</I>.
</DL>

<P>

-R
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Generate a
<B>$GIT_DIR/cvs-revisions</B>
file containing a mapping from CVS revision numbers to newly-created Git commit IDs. The generated file will contain one line for each (filename, revision) pair imported; each line will look like

<PRE>
src/widget.c 1.1 1d862f173cdc7325b6fa6d2ae1cfd61fd1b512b7
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
The revision data is appended to the file if it already exists, for use when doing incremental imports.
<P>
This option may be useful if you have CVS revision numbers stored in commit messages, bug-tracking systems, email archives, and the like.
</DL>

<P>

-h
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Print a short usage message and exit.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OUTPUT</H2>

<P>
If <B>-v</B> is specified, the script reports what it is doing.
<P>
Otherwise, success is indicated the Unix way, i.e. by simply exiting with a zero exit status.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ISSUES</H2>

<P>
Problems related to timestamps:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


If timestamps of commits in the CVS repository are not stable enough to be used for ordering commits changes may show up in the wrong order.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


If any files were ever &quot;cvs import&quot;ed more than once (e.g., import of more than one vendor release) the HEAD contains the wrong content.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


If the timestamp order of different files cross the revision order within the commit matching time window the order of commits may be wrong.
</DL>

<P>
Problems related to branches:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


Branches on which no commits have been made are not imported.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


All files from the branching point are added to a branch even if never added in CVS.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


This applies to files added to the source branch
<B>after</B>
a daughter branch was created: if previously no commit was made on the daughter branch they will erroneously be added to the daughter branch in git.
</DL>

<P>
Problems related to tags:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


Multiple tags on the same revision are not imported.
</DL>

<P>
If you suspect that any of these issues may apply to the repository you want to import, consider using cvs2git:

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<B>WARNING:</B> <B>git cvsimport</B> uses cvsps version 2, which is considered deprecated; it does not work with cvsps version 3 and later. If you are performing a one-shot import of a CVS repository consider using m[blue]<B>cvs2git</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT> or m[blue]<B>cvs-fast-export</B>m[]<FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>.
<P>
Imports a CVS repository into Git. It will either create a new repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.
<P>
Splitting the CVS log into patch sets is done by <I>cvsps</I>. At least version 2.1 is required.
<P>
<B>WARNING:</B> for certain situations the import leads to incorrect results. Please see the section ISSUES for further reference.
<P>
You should <B>never</B> do any work of your own on the branches that are created by <I>git cvsimport</I>. By default initial import will create and populate a &quot;master&quot; branch from the CVS repositorycqs main branch which youcqre free to work with; after that, you need to <I>git merge</I> incremental imports, or any CVS branches, yourself. It is advisable to specify a named remote via -r to separate and protect the incoming branches.
<P>
If you intend to set up a shared public repository that all developers can read/write, or if you want to use <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+git-cvsserver">git-cvsserver</A></B>(1), then you probably want to make a bare clone of the imported repository, and use the clone as the shared repository. See <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+gitcvs-migration">gitcvs-migration</A></B>(7).

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

-v
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Verbosity: let
<I>cvsimport</I>
report what it is doing.
</DL>

<P>

-d &lt;CVSROOT&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The root of the CVS archive. May be local (a simple path) or remote; currently, only the :local:, :ext: and :pserver: access methods are supported. If not given,
<I>git cvsimport</I>
will try to read it from
<B>CVS/Root</B>. If no such file exists, it checks for the
<B>CVSROOT</B>
environment variable.
</DL>

<P>

&lt;CVS_module&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The CVS module you want to import. Relative to &lt;CVSROOT&gt;. If not given,
<I>git cvsimport</I>
tries to read it from
<B>CVS/Repository</B>.
</DL>

<P>

-C &lt;target-dir&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The Git repository to import to. If the directory doesncqt exist, it will be created. Default is the current directory.
</DL>

<P>

-r &lt;remote&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The Git remote to import this CVS repository into. Moves all CVS branches into remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt; akin to the way
<I>git clone</I>
uses
<I>origin</I>
by default.
</DL>

<P>

-o &lt;branch-for-HEAD&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When no remote is specified (via -r) the
<B>HEAD</B>
branch from CVS is imported to the
<I>origin</I>
branch within the Git repository, as
<B>HEAD</B>
already has a special meaning for Git. When a remote is specified the
<B>HEAD</B>
branch is named remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/master mirroring
<I>git clone</I>
behaviour. Use this option if you want to import into a different branch.
<P>
Use
<I>-o master</I>
for continuing an import that was initially done by the old cvs2git tool.
</DL>

<P>

-i
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Import-only: doncqt perform a checkout after importing. This option ensures the working directory and index remain untouched and will not create them if they do not exist.
</DL>

<P>

-k
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Kill keywords: will extract files with
<I>-kk</I>
from the CVS archive to avoid noisy changesets. Highly recommended, but off by default to preserve compatibility with early imported trees.
</DL>

<P>

-u
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Convert underscores in tag and branch names to dots.
</DL>

<P>

-s &lt;subst&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Substitute the character &quot;/&quot; in branch names with &lt;subst&gt;
</DL>

<P>

-p &lt;options-for-cvsps&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Additional options for cvsps. The options
<B>-u</B>
and
<I>-A</I>
are implicit and should not be used here.
<P>
If you need to pass multiple options, separate them with a comma.
</DL>

<P>

-z &lt;fuzz&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Pass the timestamp fuzz factor to cvsps, in seconds. If unset, cvsps defaults to 300s.
</DL>

<P>

-P &lt;cvsps-output-file&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Instead of calling cvsps, read the provided cvsps output file. Useful for debugging or when cvsps is being handled outside cvsimport.
</DL>

<P>

-m
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message. This option will enable default regexes that try to capture the source branch name from the commit message.
</DL>

<P>

-M &lt;regex&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Attempt to detect merges based on the commit message with a custom regex. It can be used with
<B>-m</B>
to enable the default regexes as well. You must escape forward slashes.
<P>
The regex must capture the source branch name in $1.
<P>
This option can be used several times to provide several detection regexes.
</DL>

<P>

-S &lt;regex&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Skip paths matching the regex.
</DL>

<P>

-a
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Import all commits, including recent ones. cvsimport by default skips commits that have a timestamp less than 10 minutes ago.
</DL>

<P>

-L &lt;limit&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Limit the number of commits imported. Workaround for cases where cvsimport leaks memory.
</DL>

<P>

-A &lt;author-conv-file&gt;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
CVS by default uses the Unix username when writing its commit logs. Using this option and an author-conv-file maps the name recorded in CVS to author name, e-mail and optional time zone:

</DL>




<P>
<I>git cvsimport</I>
will make it appear as those authors had their GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL set properly all along. If a time zone is specified, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE will have the corresponding offset applied.
<P>
For convenience, this data is saved to
<B>$GIT_DIR/cvs-authors</B>
each time the
<I>-A</I>
option is provided and read from that same file each time
<I>git cvsimport</I>
is run.
<P>
It is not recommended to use this feature if you intend to export changes back to CVS again later with
<I>git cvsexportcommit</I>.
</DL>

<P>

-R
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Generate a
<B>$GIT_DIR/cvs-revisions</B>
file containing a mapping from CVS revision numbers to newly-created Git commit IDs. The generated file will contain one line for each (filename, revision) pair imported; each line will look like

<PRE>
src/widget.c 1.1 1d862f173cdc7325b6fa6d2ae1cfd61fd1b512b7
</PRE>

</DL>




<P>
The revision data is appended to the file if it already exists, for use when doing incremental imports.
<P>
This option may be useful if you have CVS revision numbers stored in commit messages, bug-tracking systems, email archives, and the like.
</DL>

<P>

-h
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Print a short usage message and exit.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OUTPUT</H2>

<P>
If <B>-v</B> is specified, the script reports what it is doing.
<P>
Otherwise, success is indicated the Unix way, i.e. by simply exiting with a zero exit status.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ISSUES</H2>

<P>
Problems related to timestamps:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


If timestamps of commits in the CVS repository are not stable enough to be used for ordering commits changes may show up in the wrong order.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


If any files were ever &quot;cvs import&quot;ed more than once (e.g., import of more than one vendor release) the HEAD contains the wrong content.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


If the timestamp order of different files cross the revision order within the commit matching time window the order of commits may be wrong.
</DL>

<P>
Problems related to branches:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


Branches on which no commits have been made are not imported.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


All files from the branching point are added to a branch even if never added in CVS.
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


This applies to files added to the source branch
<B>after</B>
a daughter branch was created: if previously no commit was made on the daughter branch they will erroneously be added to the daughter branch in git.
</DL>

<P>
Problems related to tags:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
*


Multiple tags on the same revision are not imported.
</DL>

<P>
If you suspect that any of these issues may apply to the repository you want to import, consider using cvs2git:
