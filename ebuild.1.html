ebuild - a low level interface to the Portage system
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>ebuild</B>

<I>file command [command]</I>...

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The ebuild program is a direct interface to the Portage system. It
allows for direct action upon an ebuild with specific subcommands or
groups of commands to perform in a specific ebuild's context and
functions.  Accepting an ebuild script and one or more commands
as arguments, the ebuild program parses the ebuild script and
executes the specified commands.  Commands exist to fetch sources,
unpack sources, compile sources, install object files into a temporary
directory &quot;image&quot;, merge the image to the local filesystem, create a
bzipped tarball package out of the image, and more.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILE</H2>

This must be a valid ebuild script.  For further information read
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+ebuild">ebuild</A></B>(5).
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMANDS</H2>

By default, portage will execute all the functions in order up to the
one actually specified, except for the functions that have already been
executed in a previous invocation of ebuild.  For example, simply issuing the
command <B>compile</B> will trigger the functions before it to also be run (such
as <B>setup</B> and <B>unpack</B>), unless they were run in a previous invocation
of ebuild.  If you want to make sure they are all run, you need to use
the command <B>clean</B> first.  If you wish to only have the specified command
run, then you should use the <I>noauto</I> option in the <B>FEATURES</B>
environment variable.  See the <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+make.conf">make.conf</A></B>(5) man page for more
information.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>help</B>

<DD>
Shows a condensed form of this man page along with a lot of package
specific information.
<DT><B>setup</B>

<DD>
Runs all package-specific setup actions and exotic system checks.
<DT><B>clean</B>

<DD>
Cleans the temporary build directory that Portage has created for
this particular ebuild file.  The temporary build directory normally
contains the extracted source files as well as a possible
&quot;install image&quot; (all the files that will be merged to the local
filesystem or stored in a package).  The location of the build
directory is set by the PORTAGE_TMPDIR variable.  For information
on what this variable is, run <I>emerge --info</I>, or to override
this variable, see <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+make.conf">make.conf</A></B>(5).
<P>
Note: Portage cleans up almost everything after a package has been
successfully merged unless FEATURES contains 'noclean'.  Adding noclean
to FEATURES will cause a lot of files to remain and will consume large
amounts of space, very quickly.  It is not recommended to leave this on,
unless you have use for the sources post-merge.  Optionally, one may
manually clean these files with <I>rm -rf /var/tmp/portage</I>.
<DT><B>fetch</B>

<DD>
Checks to see if all the sources specified in SRC_URI are available in
DISTDIR (see <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+make.conf">make.conf</A></B>(5) for more information) and have a valid
checksum.  If the sources aren't available, an attempt is made to
download them from the locations specified in SRC_URI.  If multiple
download locations are listed for a particular file, Portage pings
each location to see which location is closer. (May not be true
presently.)  The Gentoo Linux mirrors defined by GENTOO_MIRRORS is
always considered first.  If for some reason the current or
just-downloaded sources' checksums don't match those recorded
in files/digest-[package]-[version-rev], a warning is printed
and ebuild exits with an error code of 1.
<DT><B>digest</B>

<DD>
This is now equivalent to the <I>manifest</I> command.
<DT><B>manifest</B>

<DD>
Updates the manifest file for the package.  This creates checksums for all
of the files found in the same directory as the current ebuild as well as
the recursive contents of the files subdirectory. It also creates checksums
for all of the files listed in SRC_URI for each ebuild. For further
information regarding the behavior of this command, see the documentation for
the <I>assume-digests</I> value of the <B>FEATURES</B> variable in
<B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+make.conf">make.conf</A></B>(5). See the <B>--force</B> option if you would like to
prevent digests from being assumed.
<DT><B>unpack</B>

<DD>
Extracts the sources to a subdirectory in the <I>build directory</I>
(BUILD_PREFIX) by running the <I>src_unpack()</I> function in the ebuild
file.  If no src_unpack() function has been specified, a default
src_unpack() function is used that extracts all the files specified in
SRC_URI.  The sources are normally extracted to
${BUILD_PREFIX}/[package]-[version-rev]/work.  This particular directory
can be referenced by using the ${WORKDIR} variable.
<P>
If you're creating an ebuild, you'll want to make sure that the S
(source directory) variable defined at the top of your ebuild script
points to the directory that contains your extracted sources.  This
directory is defined by default to be ${WORKDIR}/${P}, so it is not
often required.  The src_unpack() function is also responsible for
making the appropriate patches to the sources so that they're ready
for compilation.
<DT><B>prepare</B>

<DD>
Prepares the extracted sources by running the <I>src_prepare()</I>
function specified in the ebuild file. When src_prepare() starts, the
current working directory will be set to ${S}. This function is supported
beginning with <B>EAPI 2</B>.
<DT><B>configure</B>

<DD>
Configures the extracted sources by running the <I>src_configure()</I>
function specified in the ebuild file. When src_configure() starts, the
current working directory will be set to ${S}. This function is supported
beginning with <B>EAPI 2</B>.
<DT><B>compile</B>

<DD>
Compiles the extracted sources by running the <I>src_compile()</I>
function specified in the ebuild file.  When src_compile() starts, the
current working directory will be set to ${S}.  When src_compile()
completes, the sources should be fully compiled.
<DT><B>test</B>

<DD>
Runs package-specific test cases to verify that everything was built
properly.
<DT><B>preinst</B>

<DD>
Runs package-specific actions that need to be done before the package
is installed into the live filesystem.
<DT><B>install</B>

<DD>
Installs the package to the temporary <I>install directory</I> by running
the <I>src_install()</I> function.  When completed, the
<I>install directory</I> (${BUILD_PREFIX}/[package]-[version-rev]/image)
will contain all the files that should either be merged to the local
filesystem or included in a binary package.
<DT><B>postinst</B>

<DD>
Runs package-specific actions that need to be done after the package
is installed into the live filesystem.  Usually helpful messages are
shown here.
<DT><B>qmerge</B>

<DD>
This function installs all the files in the <I>install directory</I>
to the live filesystem.  The process works as follows: first, the
<I>pkg_preinst()</I> function (if specified) is run.  Then, the files
are merged into the live filesystem, and the installed files'
checksums are recorded in
<I>/var/db/pkg/${CATEGORY}/${PN}-${PVR}/CONTENTS</I>.  After
all the files have been merged, the <I>pkg_postinst()</I> function
(if specified) is executed.
<DT><B>merge</B>

<DD>
Normally, to merge an ebuild, you need to <I>fetch</I>, <I>unpack</I>,
<I>compile</I>, <I>install</I> and <I>qmerge</I>.  If you're simply
interested in merging the ebuild, you can use this command, which
will perform all these steps for you, stopping along the way if a
particular step doesn't complete successfully.
<DT><B>unmerge</B>

<DD>
This function first executes the <I>pkg_prerm()</I> function (if specified).
Then it removes all files from the live filesystem that have a valid
checksum and mtime in the package contents file.  Any empty directories
are recursively removed.  Finally, it runs <I>pkg_postrm()</I> function (if
specified).  It is safe to merge a new version of a package first and
then unmerge the old one.  In fact, this is the recommended package
upgrade method.
<DT><B>prerm</B>

<DD>
Runs package-specific actions that need to be executed before the package is
removed from the filesystem.  See also <I>unmerge</I>.
<DT><B>postrm</B>

<DD>
Runs package-specific actions that need to be executed after the package is
removed from the filesystem.  See also <I>unmerge</I>.
<DT><B>config</B>

<DD>
Runs package-specific actions that need to be executed after the emerge
process has completed.  This usually entails setup of configuration files
or other similar setups that the user may wish to run.
<DT><B>package</B>

<DD>
This command is a lot like the <I>merge</I> command, except that after
fetching, unpacking, compiling and installing, a .tbz2 binary package
tarball is created and stored in <B>PKGDIR</B> (see <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+make.conf">make.conf</A></B>(5)).
<DT><B>rpm</B>

<DD>
Builds a RedHat RPM package from the files in the temporary
<I>install directory</I>.  At the moment, the ebuild's dependency
information is not incorporated into the RPM.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--debug</B>

<DD>
Run bash with the -x option, causing it to output verbose debugging
information to stdout.
<DT><B>--color &lt; y | n &gt;</B>

<DD>
Enable or disable color output.  This option will override <I>NOCOLOR</I>
(see <B><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?5+make.conf">make.conf</A></B>(5)) and may also be used to force color output when stdout
is not a tty (by default, color is disabled unless stdout is a tty).
<DT><B>--force</B>

<DD>
When used together with the digest or manifest command,
this option forces regeneration of
digests for all distfiles associated with the current ebuild. Any distfiles
that do not already exist in ${DISTDIR} will be automatically fetched.
<DT><B>--ignore-default-opts</B>

<DD>
Do not use the <I>EBUILD_DEFAULT_OPTS</I> environment variable.
<DT><B>--skip-manifest</B>

<DD>
Skip all manifest checks.
